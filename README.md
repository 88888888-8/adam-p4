*Markdown Here* is a Google Chrome extension that lets you write email in Markdown and render it before sending.

Writing email with code in it pretty tedious. Writing Markdown with code in it is easy. I found myself writing email in Markdown in the Github in-browser editor, then copying the preview into email. This is a pretty absurd workflow, so I decided create a tool to write and render Markdown right in the email.

## Installation

### Via the Chrome Web Store

Go to the [Chrome Web Store page for *Markdown Here*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bonncgjadmfcadjlopgmclakggdgpdnm) and install normally.

### Manual/Development

1. Clone this repo.
2. In Chrome, open the Extensions settings. (Wrench button, Tools, Extensions.)
3. On the Extensions settings page, click the "Developer Mode" checkbox.
4. Click the now-visible "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" button. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo.
5. The *Markdown Here* extension should now be visible in your extensions list.
6. Reload your webmail page before trying to convert an email.

## Use

1. In Chrome, log into your Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo account and start a new email.
2. Make sure you're using the rich editor. (In Gmail, click the "Rich formatting" link, if it's visible.)
3. Compose an email in Markdown. For example:

    ```
    **Hello** `world`.
    ```

4. Right-click in the compose box and choose the "Markdown Here" item from the context menu.
5. You should see your email rendered correctly from Markdown into rich HTML.
6. Send your awesome email to everyone you know. It will appear to them the same way it looks to you.

### Revert to Markdown

After rendering your Markdown to pretty HTML, you can still get back to your original Markdown. Simply follow the same instructions as above -- your email compose body will change back to the Markdown you had written.

Note that any changes you make to the pretty HTML will be lost when you revert to Markdown.

In Gmail, you can also use the browser's Undo command (ctrl+z/cmd+z, or from the Edit menu). Be warned that you might also use the last few characters you entered.

## Notes

* *Markdown Here* uses [Github Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

* Even though the extension is only known to work (to varying degrees )with Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail, we're not restricting what URLs the extension applies to. The hope is that it'll work in unexpected places. Reports of good (or bad) functionality is appreciated (create an issue). In the future the set of target URLs should be restricted.

### Replies

Replies don't work very well. New Markdown (at the top, say) gets parsed fine, but the body of the previous email gets messed up (stripped of formatting, usually).

Some ideas for better behaviour:

* Add a command to convert the original email to Markdown. Then it can be converted back to HTML along with the new stuff.
  * Check out [to-markdown](https://github.com/domchristie/to-markdown), a HTML-to-Markdown converter.
  * This approach will surely be flaky.
  * Will need to accommodate users who only realize after writing some Markdown that they need to convert HTML to MD. So either let them convert a selection, or don't destroy their new MD while converting.
  
* Introduce a delimiter so that the user can indicate the extent of the Markdown conversion. So they can exclude the original email from the conversion.
  * Or maybe we can detect it, based on the "on this date, this person sent this email" line.
  * If there are start and end delimiters, it could be used for inline replies.
  
* Add ability to only do the Markdown conversion on a selection. 
  * Slightly mouse-y and fiddly, but maybe not bad.
  * Possibly a good general feature.
  * Can be used for inline replies as well.

## Compatibility

Short answer: Gmail is great.

    <td>Paragraph tags are lost (or replaced?).</td>

*Compose*
> How *Markdown Here* behaves when composing an email. E.g., if rendering and reverting looks correct, styling is good, etc.

*Send*
> Negative effect that may occur when sending a rendered email from this webmail client. E.g., stripped tags and styles.

*Receive*
> How well this webmail client displays rendered email that it receives (assuming the sender is perfect).

## Next Steps

* Make replies not busted.
  * See notes in [Replies section](#replies).

* Support embedded images? That will certainly deviate from straight Markdown, but maybe okay.

* Better CSS.

* Syntax hightlighting!
  * Use [Highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/)?

* Add user option to create custom CSS.

* Add a configurable hotkey.

* Minify? Is there any advantage in extensions?

* Add user option to specify Markdown dialect?

* Maybe use [to-markdown](https://github.com/domchristie/to-markdown) to convert rich-edited email to Markdown. This seems kind of dumb, but it might help with replies to already-rich emails.

## Credits

### Other stuff not used, but to keep an eye on

* Markdown-to-HTML: 
  * [evilstreak / markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) (There's currently a GFM dialect that seems almost finished. See [issue #41](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js/issues/41).)
  * [Pagedown](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/)
  * [isaacs / github-flavored-markdown](https://github.com/isaacs/github-flavored-markdown) (A Showdown derivative)
  * [Showdown](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown)

* CSS:
  * [Mou.app](http://mouapp.com/)'s CSS looks pretty good. It can be found [here](https://github.com/borismus/markdown-preview/issues/16). I'm hesitant to use it because Mou isn't FOSS. 
  * This [Github theme for Mou](https://github.com/gcollazo/mou-theme-github2) might be good, though.

# Notes

> This file is a catch-all for ideas, problems, plans, and other miscellaneous notes. If something should instead be an issue, it should be made an issue.

- What should the upper bound on compatible Thunderbird versions be? (Too low now?)
  - Might need to push out an interim release.

- Add options to Firefox/Thunderbird
  - Add open-on-update page as well
  - If/when we pass review

- un-module-ify 3rd party apps? Unnecessary change that just makes it harder to pull upstream.

- Marked: trailing (and leading?) newlines lost from fenced blocks. Create issue?

- Update selection conversion screenshot to not be all about replies.

- Submit to Lifehacker.

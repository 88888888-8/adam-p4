# Notes

> This file is a catch-all for ideas, problems, plans, and other miscellaneous notes. If something should instead be an issue, it should be made an issue.

- Something wrong with pasting links from address bar and then converting them? Closing `</a>` shows.

- Annoying empty line at top of pasted code blocks.

- un-module-ify 3rd party apps? Unnecessary change that just makes it harder to pull upstream.

- Marked: trailing (and leading?) newlines lost from fenced blocks. Create issue?

- Update selection conversion screenshot to not be all about replies.

- Submit to Lifehacker.

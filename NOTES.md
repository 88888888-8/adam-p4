# Notes

> This file is a catch-all for ideas, problems, plans, and other miscellaneous notes. If something should instead be an issue, it should be made an issue.

- Change test page to have an iframe. Its behaviour is too unlike webmail clients for some testing (like the hotkey event listening).

- un-module-ify 3rd party apps? Unnecessary change that just makes it harder to pull upstream.

- Marked: trailing (and leading?) newlines lost from fenced blocks. Create issue?

- Update selection conversion screenshot to not be all about replies.
